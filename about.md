  <h3>Hello, </h3>
  <p> My Name is <b>David Wise</b>. I live in <b>Paris</b>. I work as a  Business Analyst in a consulting company (<a href="https://www.dxc.technology/">DXC Technology)</a> and as part-time <a href="/cours">teacher</a>.</p> 

   <h3>Work</h3>
  <p> I started my business experience in <b>2013</b> by creating a startup : <a href="https://fr.petitsfrenchies.com/newsly-application-web-favoris-interview/">Newsly</a>. Our ambition was to allow anyone to <b>keep, organize and share</b> their best picks online. Imagine a bookmarking tool (Instapaper, Pocket...) merged with a social network designed for content (Pinterest, Twitter). But, because a lack of traction, and the absence of a <b>sustainable business model</b>, the project ends in <b>2015</b>. In a team of 5 people, as the CEO, I was in charge of the <b>leadership</b>, <b>marketing</b> and <b>product development</b>.</p>

  <p> At the time, modern entrepreneurship (<b>lean startup</b>) was just starting. <b>French ecosystem</b> was building itself in real time, inspired by Silicon Valley and it's literature (blogs, forums, articles, books...). I started to structure the knowledge, methodologies and tools that I would have liked to have known at the beginning of my project. This leads me to co-host a <a href="http://startuptour.mystrikingly.com/">conference</a> on the topic at <a href="https://www.numa.co/fr">NUMA</a> and give <a href="/startup">lectures</a> in my former business school. It culminated in the co-writing and animation of a <b>MOOC</b> in <b>2016</b> with <a href="https://adrienjoly.com/">Adrien Joly</a>, broadcasted on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/startuptour/?couponCode=DAVIDWISE.FR">Udemy</a> (+ 3 000 signups).</p>

  <p> Meanwhile, thanks to programming skills learned in early <b>2014</b> through a coding bootcamp called <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/"> Le Wagon</a> (batch 002), I started to create websites as a freelance. Mostly CMS and e-commerce websites (Wordpress, Squarespace) for individuals, associations et small business.</p>

  <p> <b>In 2016</b> I integrate <a href="https://www.dxc.technology/">DXC Technology</a> as a <i><b>CRM</b> Business Analyst</i>. In concrete terms it means that I help companies (Generali, Total, Engie, RCI Banque...) to choose and implement software like <b>Salesforce</b>. I intervene at three levels : 
  <ul>
  <li>On <b>scoping </b> to qualify and define the company needs.</li>
  <li>On <b> project management </b> and software <b>integration</b>.</li>
  <li>On <b>change management</b> to reassure and train end-users.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Crosswise I learn to use design thinking to define <b> business issues</b>, influence the <b>strategy</b> and agile methodology (SCRUM) to deliver <b>software</b>.</p>

  <h3>Interests</h3>

  <p>As my background suggests, I have developed a strong interest for <b> new technologies, innovation and entrepreneurship</b>. However, these are not the only topics that have my attention. </p> 

  <p><b>Politics</b>, <b>education</b> and <b>medias</b> have a prominent place. Particularly for their capacity, or too often their powerlessness, to bring <b>society issues</b> (environment, citizenship, arts, work) in the <b>public debate</b>. However, one subject, more than the others, dominates my concerns: <b>our relationship to technologies</b>. With, in mind, a quote that resonate as an omen : <i>"We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us".</i> - John Culkin (1967)</p>

  <p> In my <b>free time</b>, without depriving myself to other curiosities, I deepen the above mentioned subjects. Reading is my privileged access to them. <b>Writing </b> is my sharpest restitution tool. Without being a cinephile, <b>movies</b> and <b>TV shows</b> are entertainment that I like to immerse myself in. <b> Theater</b> and <b> standup</b> comedy, joys that are as inconstant as they are important. Listening to <b>podcasts</b>, the light of my transportations. <b>Walking</b> in Paris, a regular privilege whose <b>company</b> lightens the pace. As do for <b>traveling</b>, <b>cooking</b>, <b>music</b>, and <b>sports</b>. Still, <b>silence</b> is a shelter to which I retreat without efforts.</p>
