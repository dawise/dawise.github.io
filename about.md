  <h3>Work </h3>
  <p> Former <a href="/startups">entrepreneur</a>, I now work as a salesforce consultant at <a href="https://www.dxc.technology/"> DXC Technology </a>. I am also a freelance, sometimes.</p> 

  <p> <b>In 2013</b> I founded <a href="https://vimeo.com/89918281">Newsly</a> after having studied 5 years in a business school. Modern entrepreneurship, aka "lean startup", was just starting. I learned many things : recruiting, managing a team, building a web product, marketing and user acquisition.</p> 

  <p> Vecause of a lack of traction the experience ends in <b>september 2015</b>. Then starts a  a very creative period : a brief step<a href="https://www.brief.me/"> in a new emerging media</a>, entrepreneurship lectures in my old <a href="http://www.emlv.fr/"> business school</a>, building and designing <a href="/Portfolio">websites</a> . Finally I write a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/startuptour/?couponCode=DAVIDWISE.FR">MOOC</a> about entrepreneurship.</p> 

  <p><b>In september 2016</b> I started working in a consulting company. If you are interested in my profesionnal life you can have a look at my <a href="">Linkedin</a> profile.</p> 

  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <p> I like to : <a href="/bibliotheque">Read</a>, taking notes, doing screenshots, making lists, argue, <a href="/bibliotheque">learn</a>, practicing sports, taking the bus, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dawise_/">travel</a>, write, send <a href="https://giphy.com/">GIFS</a>, politics, insert links a bit everywhere (as you may have noticed) </p>

  <p> If I had to choose the <b>verb</b> that suits me the best I'd say : <b>Transmit</b>.
