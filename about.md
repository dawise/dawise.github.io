  <h3>Hi, </h3>
  <p> My Name is <b>David Wise</b> . I used to be an <a href="/startups">entrepreneur</a> and I now work as a <a href="https://www.dxc.technology/"> consultant </a>. Sometimes I also do some freelancing teaching.</p> 

   <h3>Career</h3>
  <p> <b>In 2013</b> I founded <a href="https://vimeo.com/89918281">Newsly</a> after having studied 5 years in a business school. Modern entrepreneurship (aka <b>lean startup</b>) was just starting. I learned many things : recruiting, managing a team, building a web product, marketing and user acquisition.</p> 

  <p> Because of a lack of <b>traction</b> the experience ends in <b>september 2015</b>. Then starts a very creative period : a brief step<a href="https://www.brief.me/"> in a new media</a>, entrepreneurship lectures in my old <a href="http://www.emlv.fr/"> business school</a>, building and designing <a href="/Portfolio">websites</a>, producing a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/startuptour/?couponCode=DAVIDWISE.FR">MOOC</a> about entrepreneurship.</p> 

  <p><b>In september 2016</b> I started working as a consultant at <a href="https://www.dxc.technology/">DXC</a> to help companies transform their business into the digital age with software, such as <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a>.</p> 

  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <p> I started with my professionals experiences, but it doesn't say all about me. <b> My two favorite verb are :</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>Discover</li> 
  <li>Transmit</li>
  </ul> 

  <p> As far as I can remember, <b>education</b> as always had a special place in my interests. I like to discover, understand, learn, transmit and repeat this infinite loop. I closely follow, and observe, how <b>technologies</b> are changing our daily lives. I am passionated about the History of Innovation. I believe it helps me better understand the world we live in with some perspective.</p>
