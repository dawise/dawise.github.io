**Wow, it’s been 2 years.**

2 years of ups and downs. 2 years I finished school. 2 years of doing amazing diverse things : Working at [Prêt a Manger](http://www.pretamanger.fr/fr-fr/), meeting the [Aromates](http://www.aromates.fr/) team, learning code at [Le Wagon](http://www.lewagon.com/), building **Newsly**, being a freelance, and even [delivering food](https://instagram.com/p/9bLw2ruT6J/?taken-by=dawise_) these last days !

[![](/assets/article_images/2015-11-01-entrepreneurship-lessons-learned/vimeo_newsly_pitch_video.png)](https://vimeo.com/89918281)

As most of of you know, building [Newsly](https://web.archive.org/web/20150424115941/https://www.newsly.me/) was the common denominator of all these things. With one unachieved vision : transforming information we consume everyday on the web, into searchable & accessible knowledge.

Apparently we didn’t bring the right solution to the market. I believe it’s still a crucial transition for our century : leaving the **information society to reach a knowledge society**. With technologies as a **bridge**.

#### During this journey I learned a few important things that I’ll remember for sure. I am happy to share some with you :

**1/** I learned that we, as human beings, strangely over-value ideas. **Instead, execution is key**. An idea has 0$ value until it works and people want your product. ([Hey Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898))

**2/** I learned that entrepreneurship is **“All In” or go home**. You don’t build a startup if you are looking for some cool time or a no-boss policy. ([Hey Dustin](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/good-and-bad-reasons-to-become-an-entrepreneur-decf0766de8d))

**3/** I learned that **your solution is not, actually, people’s (fucking) problem** ([Hey Dave](http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2009/08/your-solution-is-not-my-problem.html)). If you don’t solve people’s problems, they’ll have no time for an unuseful product. Even your friends & family.

**4/** I learned that **attention is the game**. ([Hey Gary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnXijAxiy8g)) It’s the most valuable — and hard — thing to obtain from anyone : Users ; Customers ; Partners ; Investors. Bring value before asking for anything, to anyone.

**5/** I learned that **if you don’t try anything you’ll get absolutely nothing**. Anything you earn is provoked on a certain level, even if its just by your thoughts. Mindset is contagious.

**6/** I learned that **startups stories are much more complicated** than what they look like in the Press. Media like to tell nice stories because people like to listen to nice stories.

**7/** I learned that **it’s not the smarter guy who wins at this game**, but just the one who learns fast enough to improve constantly and **maintain growth**. ([Hey Paul](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html))

**8/** I learned that entrepreneurship is a **survival game**. Your only goal is to be alive the next month ([Hey Airbnb](https://pando.com/2013/01/10/brian-chesky-i-lived-on-capn-mccains-and-obama-os-got-airbnb-out-of-debt/)) and grow. Because after a couple of years, the market has always the last word. Except if you are **Elon Musk**. Then, you have a decade :)


**Even if things didn’t work out as expected**, I learned how exciting was to build a software solution ; Feeling that (you might be) useful to people is deeply awesome.


### NEXT

From monday 2nd of November I’ll start working at [Brief.me](https://www.brief.me/) focusing on **growth and user acquisition**. I am very happy about it : it’s in the news industry and for a **product** I use **everyday since** January 2015. I am excited to learn with new goals and join a new team.

I’ll also give some lectures about **startups** in my old **University** : [Pôle Léonard de Vinci](http://www.devinci.fr/). I can’t wait to be in a class where I wished I had been as a student 2 years ago.

Before leaving the entrepreneurship world I just wanted to **wish good luck to all the friends & people** I have made one this road. I know the ups and downs : you have my full support.

I’ll continue to write about technologies and startups here on **my website** and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dawise_). Stay tuned.
