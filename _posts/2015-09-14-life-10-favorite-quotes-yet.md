Getting older makes you think.

I am about to be **25 years old** and I love quotes. So, I asked myself :

*What are the quotes that really changed me ?*

You know : the one that makes you **think**; the one that changes the way you see the world. So here they are : **10 quotes for 10 values** that I try to **reach every day** in order to become a better human being. And of course, I still have a lot of work on that.

## 1. Humility

After all, we only have 5 senses (and a brain) to be connected to the world. It’s certainly not enough to be aware of everything happening around us. Even if we make [huge progresses on that path](https://youtu.be/4c1lqFXHvqI).(You have to see this video)

We probably feel [10% of what the world has to offer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave).

That’s why for me, humility it’s the **most important value** of ALL.

We don’t know everything about the world ; About our friends ; About that upset stranger we just crossed down the street; Sometimes even about our work. And it’s totally OK !

We often forget to **let it go** and keep moving forward. Life is just too short too be trapped by our ego.

*“The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubt, while the stupid one are full of confidence.”* — **Charles Bukowski**

## 2. Be Yourself & Shine

**Oscar Wild** famously said : *“Be yourself, everyone else is taken.”*

I feel that too much people are using *“be yourself”*, as a an excuse for they worst behaviors. Actually, I believe it’s more an invitation to be the *best version* of ourself.

**Shining ?** Yes. We are too often focused on looking for someone — or a “special one” — that is going to **change** our life and make us a better person.

But maybe, **we could just start by [being the light](https://medium.com/@HugoAmsellem/on-being-a-better-baker-ddd1d46e7671) we are permanently looking for.**

By being our true self we attract the right people. Something like : **“Your vibe, attracts your tribe.”**.

## 3. Listening

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/teacherandclue-elisabethgilbert-quote-davidwise.jpg)

As [François Truffaut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut) once said : *“Life has far more imagination than we have.”*

Sometimes our brain and ego make plans and we stop listening to what life actually wants to tell us.

I believe we have so much to learn from the people we meet, and the experience we make.

**It’s a kind of my life motto.**

That’s why I believe serendipity is such an important thing. Even if it’s hard — sometimes — to know where we should allow our attention on.

## 4. Inner Honesty

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/confidencefaceallthequestions-notalltheanswers-davidwise.jpg)

This one is **powerful** because it mixes : humility, being yourself, and listening.

Honesty starts with being in peace [with ourself](https://medium.com/@RomarioBastide/the-secret-ingredient-to-happiness-46e6dd6f82d3). It’s something very **intimate**, but so important to face life properly.

I [read](https://medium.com/@Clarazeld/m%C3%A9tamorphose-learning-n-4-be-sincere-rather-than-transparent-3f31cbdc788) an interesting difference between **authenticity** and transparency : *“It is important to make distinction between being transparent and being clear. As I have learned, more exposure to information doesn’t equate with true understanding”* — **John Maeda**

It’s ok to have our secret garden (and quite healthy ), we just need to be **clear** with ourself, and the people that surround us.

For work and professional life, honesty is close to **self awareness**, [which is also very important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6tKf1IR5j8). Right Gary ?

## 5. Be the change

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/The_world_is changed_by_your example_dawise.jpg)

This is a **stronger** version of the famous Gandhi’s quotation : *“Be the change your wan’t to see in the world.”*

Probably the **most important quote** of the selection. Very **few things change by our opinion, but so much can be changed by our simple example**. This is where credibility stands.

This is why parents, teachers, brothers, sisters, or any others person in **contact with kids**, have such an important role. Because as we grow, we tend to reproduce what w’ve seen as a kid. **So let’s start to be the generation** that shows the right way.

How can we expect to see the changes that we are not able to make ourselves ?

## 6. Life is an echo ?

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/lifeisanecho-ziglar-dawise.jpg)

I am not a **scientist**, and I am not pretending to be one, but I believe things work that way.

I believe everything works on a quantum level : somewhere, every action leads to a reaction. Like the [“Butterfly Effect”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect).

The same way I believe we, human beings, are all connected. As the concept of [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) developed by **Pierre Teilhard de Chardin**, explain it.

And it’s actually a **good news** : if everything is contagious, it means we are all responsible for the world.

We can change it by our simple thoughts or actions.

## 7. Be the movement

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/bethemovement-BenjaminFranklin-dawise.jpg)

[First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX78iKhInsc), this quote made me think a lot. Like a lot. But after a while, I agreed with it. We need to be in the movement. Can we argue about the wind ? No, [it just exists](http://thewallofmotivation.tumblr.com/post/117072682910/adjust-the-sails-life-optimist-pessimist).

**Life is movement**. It’s like riding a bicycle if you stop too long, you just fall. This guy words :

> “Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving on.” — **A. Einstein**.

Whatever the direction we take, we need to **choose one**. The worst thing that could happen is being static. We always learn from doing something. If it’s positive it’s **success**, if it’s negative it’s **experience**.

It doesn’t mean to forget where we come from :

*“If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it’s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole.”* — **Sheldon Cooper, The Big Bang Theory**

## 8. Facing fears

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/doonethingeverydayscaresyou-roosvelt-e-dawise.png)

That’s maybe the most important quote for my **daily life**. If I don’t have the opportunity to do something SCARY everyday, I try at least to do something NEW. Which is close : **aren’t we afraid of the unknown ?**

So I try to do **new things** as often as possible. Even the tiny ones : changing the itinerary on my way back home to discover new streets, for exemple.

For sure, we can’t face our **biggest fears** straight away, but surely step by step, we are able to earn some **confidence** on this path. [This amazing TED explains why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16p9YRF0l-g).

> Start small, go big

They say : *“Go out of your comfort zone”*. But maybe it’s more about : **extending our comfort zone** ?

## 9. Courage

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/theonlywayisthrough-frost-dawise.jpg)

Yeah, sorry… *“the only way it’s through”*. End of the story.

Sometimes it’s **tempting to not face a problem immediately**. But the truth is : the more we wait, the more it becomes complicated and tense.

We probably have all experienced that. **By fixing things early we keep them manageable**.

*“Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know.”* — **Pema Chodron**.

## 10. Being nice

![](/assets/article_images/2015-09-14-favorite-10-quotes-yet/patiencewhennothingattitudewheneverything-dawise.jpg)

Whatever happens, even if it’s hard sometimes : Be nice to people. It’s our commun, and only, duty.

**What does it mean to me ?** Something like : “Don’t do to others what you don’t want others do to you.” — [The golden rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

Or simply, my favorite :

*“Be the person your dog thinks you are.”* — Unknown

If you are not in the position you wished to be, be patient, and do not envy people who are. Use this as a positive **inspiration**.

If you are where you consider “ the top”, don’t be a douchebag, remember where you come from. **Be grateful**.

**And You ?** What are your favorite quotes about life & how you see the world ? Do you have some kind of **life motto** ? I would love to hear about that.

P.S: If you are wondering how the quotes have been made, I used [spokenly](https://www.spoken.ly/s) (doesn’t work anymore); [Quotescover](http://www.quotescover.com/) ; [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and [Pablo](https://buffer.com/pablo). It’s really easy to make your own.

They are [all available here](http://imgur.com/a/zHIJN). Of course, feel free to use them.
