## The Farmer & the Horse


Once lived a farmer.

He received for his birthday a marvelous **horse** as a gift. His **neighbor** came to see him and told him **“You are very lucky**. No one is going to give me such a beautiful horse.”

> I don’t know if it’s a good or a bad thing… 

said the farmer. A little while after the farmer’s son rode the horse and the horse threw him out. He fell and got really hurt. **“Oh this is awful !** said the neighbor. You were right when you said it could be a bad thing. The person who bought you this horse wanted to **hurt you** ! Your son is not going to be able to walk anymore. ” The farmer didn’t look so much disturbed and said :

> I don’t know if it’s a good or a bad thing…

A little later, **the war started** and all the youths from the land where called to to be enrolled. Except the farmer’s son. The neighbor came back to the farmer and said: “ Your son is the only one of village that will not go to war, he is truly **lucky** !” And the farmer repeated one more time :

> I don’t know if it’s a good or a bad thing…
